  <h2>5. SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
  <h2>Subscription Options and Purchases</h2>
  <p>The Service offers subscription-based access to its features and content, which may be purchased either directly
    from the Company via an App Store ("<strong>In-App Purchase</strong>"). All applicable subscription fees,
    billing terms,
    and durations (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually) will be displayed on the payment screen or at checkout
    before payment authorization. Our pricing varies based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, region,
    bundle, and duration of subscription. Some limited features of the Service may be available free of charge, but full
    access requires a paid subscription.</p>
  <h2>Purchases and Payment Processing</h2>
  <p>Upon completing the onboarding process in the App, you will be presented with available subscription options, their
    pricing, durations, and accepted payment methods (e.g., Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Apple Pay). By
    selecting a
    subscription and authorizing the payment, you instruct the applicable payment processor or App Store to charge your
    selected payment method. Once the payment is validated, you will receive access to the Service.</p>
  <p>For In-App Purchases, payments are processed by the App Store, and the respective App Store's terms and
    policies govern the transaction.</p>
  <h2>Auto-Renewal and Subscription Continuity</h2>
  <p>All subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled. The renewal period matches the initial subscription term
    unless otherwise disclosed at the time of purchase. To avoid renewal, you must cancel your subscription <strong>at
      least 24
      hours before the renewal date</strong>.</p>
  <p>By proceeding with a subscription, you acknowledge that charges will be applied periodically based on the selected
    billing cycle. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period,
    excluding any promotional (introductory) and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your
    auto-renewal.</p>
  <p>For In-App Purchases, cancellation must be done through the respective App Store‚Äôs account settings.
    <strong>Deleting the
      App does not cancel your subscription</strong>.
  </p>
  <h2>Add-On Items and Additional Services</h2>
  <p>In addition to your subscription, you may have the option to purchase add-on items such as premium content,
    consultations, or supplementary features. These add-ons may be one-time purchases or recurring charges. Canceling
    your main subscription will also cancel any associated recurring add-ons, but canceling an add-on alone does not
    affect your primary subscription.</p>
  <h2>Refunds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If you subscribed or started a trial via the <strong>App Store</strong>, refund requests are handled directly by
      <strong>Apple</strong>. You can
      submit a request following the instructions on the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084"
        target="_blank">Apple Support page.</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>App Store refunds are subject to their policies. As outlined in our <a href="https://teufeltim.github.io/privacy-policy/"
      target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, your personally
    identifiable
    information may be shared with Apple to assist in responding to chargeback requests.</p>
  <h2>Free Trials and Promotional Offers</h2>
  <p>We may offer free trials providing temporary access to the Service, such as the <strong>7-Day Free Trial</strong>.
    The trial duration and terms will be displayed at sign-up. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your
    subscription will automatically convert into a paid
    subscription, and the applicable fee will be charged.</p>
  <p>We do not guarantee reminders before the trial expires. It is your responsibility to track the trial period and
    cancel if you do not wish to continue. The Company reserves the right to modify, revoke, or restrict trial
    eligibility at any time.</p>
  <h2>Promotional Codes</h2>
  <p>We may provide you with gift cards or promotional codes that can be redeemed for additional features, enhancements,
    functionalities, content, services within a specified Service and for a limited period of time, subject eligibility
    requirements (the ‚ÄúPromotional Codes‚Äù). Promotional Codes have no cash value, are personal, non-transferable,
    non-sublicensable, and we are under no obligation to provide any compensation in connection with a Promotional Code.
  </p>
  <h2>Changes to Subscription Fees</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we may modify subscription fees at any time. If notification is
    required under applicable law, we will inform you of pricing changes in the manner and timeframe mandated by
    regulations. Where no specific timeframe is prescribed, we will provide notice by posting the updated prices in the
    App, sending an email notification, or using other prominent communication methods. The revised pricing will take
    effect as specified in the notice.</p>
  <p>If you do not agree to the updated fees, you may cancel your subscription before the new pricing takes effect or
    refrain from prepaying for continued access to the Service.</p>
  <h2>Failure to Pay and Service Termination</h2>
  <p>If a payment is declined or not received when due, we may notify you to update your payment method. However, if the
    issue is not resolved, we reserve the right to <strong>suspend or terminate your access to the Service without
      further
      notice</strong>. Any content, data, or personalized settings associated with your account may be lost, and we are
    not
    responsible for restoring them.</p>

  <h2 id="11">11. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES</h2>
  <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND‚ÄîTHIS SECTION CONTROLS HOW DISPUTES
      BETWEEN YOU
      AND THE COMPANY WILL BE ADDRESSED</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>BY AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND YOU
      ARE
      WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>YOU ARE ALSO AGREEING TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION
      UNLESS YOU
      EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO REJECT ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW</strong>.</p>
  <p>You and Shengcheng Yang (‚Äúwe‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) agree to resolve all Disputes (including any
    related
    disputes involving the Company, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates) through binding arbitration, as described
    below, except for: (i) claims that fall within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, provided such claims are
    not class action disputes and also meet the court‚Äôs jurisdictional and monetary limits; and (ii) disputes related to
    intellectual property rights. A ‚ÄúDispute‚Äù means any claim, controversy, or legal action‚Äîwhether arising from past,
    present, or future events, and based on contract, tort, statute, or common law‚Äîbetween you and the Company regarding
    the Services, or this agreement (the ‚ÄúArbitration Agreement‚Äù). ‚ÄúDispute‚Äù also includes disputes about the
    interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this Arbitration Agreement,
    including whether any part of it is invalid or unenforceable.</p>
  <h2>Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice Procedure</h2>
  <p>You and we agree that good faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often result in a faster, inexpensive
    outcome. Therefore, if you intend to assert a claim for any Dispute (as defined above) against the Company, you must
    first send the Company a written notice of the Dispute (‚ÄúNotice‚Äù) that gives the Company some basic information
    about you and the Dispute. Any Notice must include (i) your name, address, and email address, (ii) a detailed
    description of your Dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding your use of the Service (including your account ID,
    profile screenshots, and anything else that will help us identify your account; (iv) a detailed description of the
    relief you are seeking, including a calculation of any money damages you are seeking; and (v) a personally signed
    statement from you (and not your attorney) verifying the accuracy of the information in Notice. The Notice must be
    individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person‚Äôs dispute. If you are filling out a
    Notice for another person, you must include all information described above, and also a statement describing your
    relationship to the person and why the person is unable to fill out the Notice for themselves.</p>
  <p>You must send the Notice to the Company at the following address:</p>
  <p><strong>9-1005 Deshang Huafu Tianjiao, Chengdu, Sichuan, China</strong></p>
  <p>Attention: Legal AI Cleaner</p>
  <p>And a copy via email to: <a href="mailto:hookupdating@outlook.com">hookupdating@outlook.com</a></p>
  <p>If we need to send you a Notice, we will send the Notice to you at the contact information we have available for
    you, which may include, if applicable, the contact information associated with your account.</p>
  <p>After we receive a Notice, you and us agree to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute between us for a
    period of 60 days through informal negotiation. The 60-day period can be extended if you and we agree that such an
    extension is likely to lead to resolution. As part of the informal negotiation process, you and we agree that we
    will both attend at least one individualized video conference (‚ÄùVideo Conference‚Äù). The Video Conference can be via
    Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, or any other similar platform that you and we agree on and that we both have access
    to. The Video Conference can be held after the 60-day period, if necessary. If you are represented by an attorney in
    your Dispute, your attorney may participate in the Video Conference, but you are still required to attend and
    participate in good faith. The Company is also required to participate in the Video Conference by sending one or
    more of its representatives, and the Company may also send one or more of its attorneys. If you are unable to
    participate in the Video Conference by video, you may attend telephonically if you certify in writing that
    circumstances exist that prevent you from appearing by video (such as your lack of access to phone with a working
    camera or your inability to connect to a stable internet connection). You and we agree that we (and our attorneys,
    if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the Video Conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time
    after we receive a Notice. You and we also agree to use our best efforts to resolve the Dispute at the Video
    Conference. If you and we cannot resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed
    Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims
    court proceeding.</p>
  <p>Compliance with these Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures is Mandatory and Pre-Filing Notice procedures
    (including the Video Conference requirement) are a condition precedent to initiating any arbitration or small claims
    court action. Failure to follow the procedures is a breach of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
  <p>The Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice procedures are essential so that you and the Company have a meaningful opportunity
    to resolve Disputes in an inexpensive and efficient manner. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration
    provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration unless the party bringing the demand for
    arbitration certifies in writing that the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice procedures (including the Video Conference
    requirement) were fully satisfied. If the party bringing the demand for arbitration fails to include a written
    certification that the Pre-Filing Notice procedures (including the Video Conference) were met, then the arbitration
    forum shall administratively close the demand for arbitration and no fees shall be due from the responding party. A
    court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration
    proceeding or small claims court action accordingly.</p>
  <p>All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice process by any
    party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and not admissible for any purpose in any subsequent
    proceeding (except as required to certify in writing that the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice procedures were completed
    before submitting a demand for arbitration). Evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be
    rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable by this section.</p>
  <h2>Small Claims Court</h2>
  <p>Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements and Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice requirements explained above, you
    or the Company may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small claims court rather than through arbitration, so long
    as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. If a party has already
    submitted an arbitration demand, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the arbitral forum that it
    chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court. At that time, the arbitral forum will administratively
    close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the
    arbitration respondent.</p>
  <h2>What is Arbitration?</h2>
  <p>Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration
    uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very
    limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award some of the same
    individualized damages and relief that a court can award. An arbitrator cannot, however, order a party to act or
    stop doing something‚Äîthis is known as ‚Äúequitable relief.‚Äù Either you or we can go to court and seek equitable
    relief, including by filing a motion to compel the other party to follow this Arbitration Agreement. However, you
    and we agree that the only courts where we will seek equitable relief are the state and federal courts in Delaware.
    This exception for equitable relief does not waive this Arbitration Agreement. You and we agree that the U.S.
    Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. A
    court of competent jurisdiction has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
    applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive
    termination of these terms and the termination of your account.</p>
  <h2>CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</h2>
  <p><strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT
      TO
      LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT DESCRIBED ABOVE). YOU AND THE
      COMPANY EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE OTHER, INCLUDING ANY
      CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR
      AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE LITIGATED IN COURT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED
      BASIS.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>EXCEPT FOR THE MASS FILING PROCEDURES DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO
        THE
        EXTENT
        NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY‚ÄôS CLAIM.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE
        ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE FOR A PARTICULAR
      CLAIM OR
      REQUEST FOR RELIEF, AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE AFFIRMED AND SUCH DECISION BECOMES FINAL, THEN YOU AND
      THE
      COMPANY AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING
      INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS
      FOUND
      TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE
      INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Arbitration Procedure</strong></p>
  <p>The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration &amp; Mediation
    ("<strong>"NAM"</strong>") (including the
    Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as
    applicable) ("<strong>NAM Rules</strong>"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by
    NAM. The NAM Rules
    are available online at <a href="http://www.namadr.com/" target="_blank">www.namadr.com</a> or by requesting them
    in writing at the Notice address listed
    above. You may
    obtain a form
    to initiate arbitration with NAM at: <a
      href="https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-3.21.2024.pdf">https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-3.21.2024.pdf</a>
    or by
    contacting NAM.</p>
  <p>If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that
    will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C.
    ¬ß5.</p>
  <p><strong>You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a written certification that they have
      complied
      with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements
      enclosed
      with any demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the
      party
      initiating arbitration (and their attorney, if represented)</strong>.</p>
  <p>The arbitration will be in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed remotely
    pursuant to the NAM Rules, as modified herein. You and the Company agree to comply with the following rules, which
    are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the
    arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen
    by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the
    parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties or the arbitrator decides that a
    formal hearing is necessary.; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court
    of competent jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in either
    Delaware, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person
    hearing may be conducted in the claimant's state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States,
    the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the NAM Rules.</p>
  <p>The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the
    disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of Florida in conducting the arbitration.
    You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.
    The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings.</p>
  <p>The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this Arbitration Agreement. In the event NAM Rules conflict with
    this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that
    strict application of any term of this Arbitration Agreement would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration,
    then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify such term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally
    fair arbitration that is consistent with efficient and inexpensive resolution of Disputes.</p>
  <p>Unless you and –°ompany otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted virtually via video or teleconference.
  </p>
  <h2>Decision of the Arbitrator</h2>
  <p>Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue their decision within 120 days from the date the
    arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of
    justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto
    will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of
    the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any
    claim.</p>
  <p>The arbitration award is binding only between you and the Company and will not have any preclusive effect in
    another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party.</p>
  <h2>Fees</h2>
  <p>The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator,
    and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable
    law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will
    be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees
    in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive,
    regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or
    brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith.</p>
  <p>You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM
    to address the reduction or deferral of fees.</p>
  <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Upon either your or our request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of
    either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except
    in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court
    filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>
  <h2>Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment</h2>
  <p>At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or the Company may serve a
    written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the
    offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly.
    If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made,
    whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an
    offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable
    award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party‚Äôs costs from the
    time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees to the
    extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded).</p>
  <p>The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing
    are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For
    arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties‚Äô attorneys agree to communicate individual
    settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers
    are extended.</p>
  <h2>Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration Filings</h2>
  <p>The following provisions set forth additional procedures that apply to mass arbitration filings. If ten (10) or
    more similar claims are asserted against the Company by the same or coordinated attorneys or are otherwise
    coordinated, consistent with the definition and criteria of ‚ÄúMass Filings‚Äù set forth in the NAM Rules, you and we
    understand and agree that these additional procedures shall apply and the resolution of your dispute might be
    delayed. You and we agree that throughout this process, our attorneys shall meet and confer to discuss modifications
    to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. You and we agree to make all reasonable
    efforts to maximize the integrity and efficiency of arbitration to resolve Disputes between us, particularly those
    involving Mass Filings, and further commit to acting in good faith to adhere to the procedures established in this
    section. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to
    result in an efficient and fair adjudication of claims.</p>
  <p>Bellwether Arbitrations for Mass Filings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration
    administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The
    parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated as the ‚ÄúInitial Test Cases,‚Äù to
    proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be
    held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other
    demands for arbitration in a Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other
    demands) will be held in abeyance, and neither you nor the Company will be required to pay any such filing fees. You
    and the Company also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Agreement for
    failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or
    other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this
    subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the
    arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of
    the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will
    render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.</p>
  <p>Global Mediation in Mass Filings. Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage
    in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the Mass Filing (<strong>"Global
      Mediation"</strong>), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test
    Cases and
    subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test
    Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to
    resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global
    Mediation, the Parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court with the remaining
    claims. Notice of the opt-out shall be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Global Mediation.
    Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations may then be filed and administered by the arbitration provider. You
    and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the global
    mediation process.</p>
  <p><strong>Severability</strong>. If any part of this Mass Arbitration provision is declared invalid, void, or
    unenforceable, then that
    provision is severable from the Arbitration Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the
    remaining provisions.</p>
